# In this program we will take the input from user.

# To take the input from user we use input() function.

# First we will take integer from user.
no1 = input("Enter a integer:")
# Here we are taking a number from user and storing it in no1 variable.

# Note: Data type of all input is alway string but we can convert it.
print(no1,"is of ",type(no1),"type")

# Let's convert its type
# To convert its type into integer we will use int() function.
no1 = int(input("Enter that number again:"))
print("After using int() function your input is of ",type(no1),"type")

# Similarly let's see more examples

no2 = input("Enter a floating number:")
print(no2,"is of ",type(no2),"type")
no2 = float(input("Enter that number again:"))
print("After using float() function your input is of ",type(no2),"type")

# In python there is no character data type. A character is also string 
# of length one.
