# First Program of Python

# In this program we will see the basic of python.Let's star it.

#print() is used to print anything on screen.
print("WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL")

# Now we will declare a variable.
a = 10
# Here a is the name of our variable. We don't need to give the datatype of
# variable.

# Let's print its value on screen.
print("a = ",a)

# To check the datatype of any variable we use type() function.
print("Type of a = ",type(a))

# To check the address of any variable we use id() function.
print("Address of a = ",id(a))

# Let's see another examples.
b = 12.5
print("b = ",b)
print("Type of b = ",type(b))
print("Address of b = ",id(b))

c = "MR SQUARE"
print("c = ",c)
print("Type of c = ",type(c))
print("Address of c = ",id(c))
